# pc-parsing
Version 2.0 of Pest Control's Parsing bot. Functional for any RotMG Raiding Discord Server. Can compare data between raiding server voice channels and screenshotted /w messages from in-game.  This code is provided AS-IS with no guidence on compilation, setup or post-installation support. You are ON YOUR OWN when you use this, so familiarity with C# is strongly advised.

Built for Ubuntu 20.04, using dotnet-core.  Depends on Tessaract and libc6-dev. Should multithread but sometimes arbitrarily chooses not to.
